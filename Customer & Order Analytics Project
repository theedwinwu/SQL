-- #In this SQL project, I'm queried a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were placed in January? 
select count(orderid)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderid) = 6 
and orderid != 'Order ID'

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
select count(orderid)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where Product = 'iPhone'
and length(orderid) = 6 and orderid != 'Order ID'

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
select distinct acctnum
from BIT_DB.customers cust
join BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
on cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
where length(orderid) = 6 
and orderid != 'Order ID'

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
select distinct product, price 
from BIT_DB.JanSales 
order by price ask LIMIT 1

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select sum(quantity)*price revenue , product
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales 
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by product

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.FebSales f
left join BIT_DB.customers c
on f.orderid=c.order_id
where Feb.Quantity>2 and length(orderid) = 6 and orderid != 'Order ID'
